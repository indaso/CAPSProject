CAPSProject
===========

This application is for a Guided Conversation between 2 users. Both users enter their names as a support provider and support receiver and begin the conversation. The support receiver will fill out before and after surveys based on mood and friendship with the support giver.

The application is split into 3 main activities. One is the opening screen, the next is the SurveyActivity, and the final one is the GuidedActivity.
